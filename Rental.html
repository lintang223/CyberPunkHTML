            <h1>MEGA Building</h1><br>
            <p>SEach megabuilding roughly features over eight thousand apartments with varying capacity. At least two thousand of these share the exact same layout. The lowers floors are usually cheaper and crammed, with the upper floors featuring luxury penthouses. The middle floors offer fairly spacious apartments that include their own bathrooms and most have a kitchen. Nonetheless, all apartments have installed wall-mounted vending machines that provide food. Mediacorps have made sure that each apartment has direct cable access to TV, radio and sensory feed.</p>
