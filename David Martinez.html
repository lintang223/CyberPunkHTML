            <h1>DAVID MARTINEZ</h1>
            <p>David Martinez was born to an unknown man and his mother Gloria Martinez, who the latter raised him by herself. He was born in the back of an ambulance, as Gloria's water broke while re-attaching the arm of an edgerunner.[5] David grew up on the streets of Santo Domingo, living out of an apartment of Megabuilding H4 in Arroyo. Due to his mother putting great effort into her job as an EMT for Night City health services, David was eligible for enrollment into the Arasaka Academy where he achieved top grades. After joining the academy, David began selling XBDs to classmates that he obtained from a ripperdoc and friend of his nicknamed Doc.</p>
